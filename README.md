# sql-parser -- SQL Parsing PoC

Parse SQL using Antlr and Spark SQL

It is a bare copy (not fork) of [ANTLR test project](https://github.com/stevenalexander/antlr-test1) with additional parsing using Apache Spark SQL's built-in parser (that uses Antlr 4, too).

The idea behind the project was to learn Antlr a bit and check out how much Spark SQL could help with SQL parsing. It appears that using both could be the final solution.
